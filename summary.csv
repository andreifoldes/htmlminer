https://anthropic.com/,0,"The organization identifies the technical alignment problem as a primary risk, where AI systems, if significantly more competent than humans, could pursue goals conflicting with human interests, leading to dire or catastrophic outcomes. This includes both the strategic pursuit of dangerous goals and innocent mistakes in high-stakes situations, particularly as AI systems become intelligent enough to understand their place, deceive, or develop strategies beyond human comprehension. The difficulty in building safe, reliable, and steerable systems increases as AI approaches human-level intelligence and awareness. 

Advanced AI systems pose risks through emergent dangerous behaviors such as toxicity, bias, unreliability, dishonesty, sycophancy, power-seeking, and deceptive alignment. These concerning behaviors may only arise when AI is very advanced, making detection and mitigation challenging. The potential for surprising capabilities to be used in problematic ways, or for AI to develop undesirable goals, represents a significant safety concern.

Rapid AI progress is also expected to cause significant societal disruption, impacting employment, macroeconomics, and global power structures. This disruption could trigger competitive races among corporations or nations to deploy untrustworthy AI systems, hindering careful development and potentially leading to further chaos. The research process itself carries risks, as efforts to ensure safety could inadvertently accelerate the deployment of dangerous technologies, necessitating careful management to mitigate these structural and societal harms.","The organization's core goal is to ensure AI systems are safe, aligned with human values, and beneficial to society. This involves a comprehensive research program focused on developing AI that is helpful, honest, harmless, reliable, and robust. A central objective is to evaluate and understand AI alignment, assess the efficacy of alignment techniques, and determine their applicability to increasingly capable AI systems, while also anticipating and preventing dangerous failure modes.

To achieve this, the organization develops new algorithms for training AI, including methods to detect concerning behaviors such as power-seeking or deception. Key approaches include scaling human supervision into high-quality AI supervision, limiting AI training to process-oriented learning, and automating red-teaming to identify and mitigate unsafe aspects. The aim is to build safe, reliable, and steerable systems, training them up to and beyond human-level capabilities while maintaining safety.

Beyond technical development, the organization seeks to provide policymakers and researchers with insights and tools to mitigate potential societal harms and ensure AI benefits are broadly distributed. This includes making externally verifiable commitments to develop advanced models only when safety standards are met, allowing independent evaluation, and integrating safety research into real systems to prevent the deployment of dangerous AIs.","Anthropic employs a multi-faceted approach to achieve its AI safety goals, primarily focusing on developing AI systems that are helpful, honest, harmless, reliable, robust, and aligned with human values. This involves creating new algorithms for training, utilizing techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and setting up controlled environments to isolate and study specific safety properties in smaller models. They also train AI systems to follow safe processes rather than just pursuing outcomes.

To ensure safety, the organization builds tools and measurements to evaluate AI capabilities, limitations, and societal impact. This includes improving understanding of how AI systems learn and generalize, studying generalization using influence functions, and reverse engineering neural networks to create transparent and interpretable AI. A key method is developing techniques to detect concerning behaviors such as power-seeking or deception in advanced AI systems.

Furthermore, Anthropic conducts rigorous safety testing and mitigation. This involves red teaming language models to discover and reduce harms, automating adversarial training, and testing for dangerous failure modes. They also develop methods for scalable oversight and commit to only developing models beyond certain capability thresholds if safety standards are met, often allowing independent external organizations to evaluate both model capabilities and safety."
