https://anthropic.com/,0,"The organization identifies significant risks associated with AI development, primarily centered on the technical alignment problem. This involves the potential for AI systems, especially those more competent than humans, to pursue goals that conflict with human interests, leading to dire or catastrophic consequences. These risks include AI making innocent mistakes in high-stakes situations or strategically pursuing dangerous objectives.

Further risks involve the emergence of concerning behaviors in advanced AI, such as deception, power-seeking, strategic planning abilities, toxicity, bias, unreliability, and dishonesty. Rapid AI progress is also anticipated to cause profound societal disruption, impacting employment, macroeconomics, and power structures globally. This disruption could trigger competitive races, potentially leading nations or corporations to deploy untrustworthy AI systems, and could also generate dangerous technical knowledge that threatens national security.

Overall, the impact of AI is considered comparable to industrial and scientific revolutions, with an uncertain outcome. The research process itself carries risks, including the possibility of inadvertently accelerating the deployment of dangerous technologies or eliciting hazardous capacities within AI models.","The organization's core goal is to develop AI systems that are helpful, honest, harmless, reliable, robust, and aligned with human values. This involves creating new algorithms and techniques for training safe and transparent systems, including those that may exceed human-level capabilities, and rapidly integrating the latest safety research into practical applications. A fundamental aim is to discover and disseminate safe methodologies for training powerful AI systems, thereby ensuring that the risks posed by advanced AI remain low.

To achieve these objectives, the organization focuses on rigorously evaluating and understanding AI alignment, assessing the efficacy of alignment techniques, and predicting their scalability. This encompasses developing methods to detect concerning behaviors such as power-seeking or deception, anticipating dangerous failure modes, and auditing models for safety. Efforts also include reverse engineering neural networks, automating adversarial training, and securing frontier AI models against misuse, such as nuclear proliferation risks.

Beyond technical development, the organization aims to equip policymakers and researchers with the insights and tools necessary to mitigate potential societal harms and ensure the broad and equitable distribution of AI's benefits. This commitment extends to transparency, making externally legible commitments regarding safety standards, and facilitating independent evaluation of models. The overarching goal is to channel collective efforts towards AI safety research, warn against unsafe deployments, and build trustworthy AI systems for all users.","The organization employs a multi-faceted approach to ensure AI systems are helpful, honest, harmless, reliable, robust, and aligned with human values. This includes developing new algorithms and training these properties into small-scale models for isolated study. They utilize techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to guide AI systems towards safe processes and improve understanding of how AI systems learn and generalize, including detailed analysis of large language model training procedures and generalization using influence functions.

Key methods involve comprehensive evaluation and understanding of AI capabilities, limitations, and potential societal impacts. They build tools and measurements to assess AI systems, research predictability in large language models, and work to reverse engineer neural networks for interpretability. To mitigate harms, the organization actively detects and prevents dangerous failure modes, develops techniques to identify concerning behaviors like power-seeking or deception, and employs red teaming (both manual and automated) to discover and reduce offensive outputs. They also trace model outputs back to training data and deploy classifiers on live traffic, such as on Claude.

Furthermore, the organization is committed to responsible AI policies and governance. This involves making externally legible commitments to develop models beyond certain capability thresholds only if safety standards are met, and allowing independent, external organizations to evaluate both model capabilities and safety. They engage in public-private partnerships, such as with the U.S. Department of Energy's NNSA for developing nuclear safeguards for AI, and share their approaches with broader initiatives like the Frontier Model Forum."
