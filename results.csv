Key activities include grantmaking, research, and partnerships. A specific focus is on replicating highly cited social science studies through the Institute for Replication to verify results. Other methods include implementing solutions through low-cost devices in healthcare facilities (e.g., Kenya) and employing negotiation and public campaigns to persuade entities (e.g., 3,000 food companies to shift to cage-free eggs).","partners with leading donors | directed over $4 billion in grants | null | null | null | null | conduct in-depth research to identify the areas where our funding can help others the most | research | grantmaking | partnerships | replicating highly cited studies to check whether the results hold up | The Institute for Replication addresses a core problem in social science by replicating highly cited studies to check whether the results hold up | The Institute for Replication addresses a core problem in social science by replicating highly cited studies to check whether the results hold up | through a low-cost device | installed in health care facilities across Kenya | persuaded more than 3,000 food companies worldwide to shift to using cage-free eggs | negotiation | public campaigns",18
